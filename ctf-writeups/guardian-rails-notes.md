# Guardian Rails – Notes

Guardian Rails focuses on securing smart contract patterns.

---

## Key Themes

- Defense-in-depth rather than relying on a single check.
- Importance of principle of least privilege.
- Building rails around dangerous operations:
  - Upgradeability
  - Admin actions
  - Fund movements

---

## Takeaways

- Many exploits are not “zero-days” but the result of weak assumptions.
- Well-designed guardrails can turn catastrophic exploits into contained failures.
- The course improved the way I think about:
  - Pre-conditions
  - Invariants
  - Failing safely.
