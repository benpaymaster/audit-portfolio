# Smart Contract Vulnerability Suite

This folder contains a curated set of **common smart contract vulnerability types**, including:

- Real exploit mechanics
- How to detect them during audits
- Example vulnerable code snippets (sanitised)
- Recommended remediations

The purpose is to demonstrate adversarial reasoning and practical security knowledge across the most exploited patterns in DeFi and EVM smart contracts.

Each vulnerability file includes:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability  
2. **Why it occurs**  
3. **Exploit scenario**  
4. **How to detect it during audits**  
5. **Remediation strategies**  
6. **Example secure code pattern**
