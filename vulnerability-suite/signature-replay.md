# Oracle Manipulation

## Description
When protocols rely on AMM spot prices, attackers can manipulate liquidity pools to influence price-dependent logic.

## Exploit Example
Using a single large swap or flash loan, an attacker can:
- Move the pool price temporarily
- Trigger liquidations or mispriced trades
- Exploit protocols reading the price in the same tx

## Mitigation
- Use TWAPs
- Use multiple oracles
- Limit the effect of a single block’s price
